# Computational Insights into the Pharmacokinetics and Molecular Interactions of Camptothecin Derivatives: A SwissADME, Docking, and Molecular Dynamics Study
The assessment of drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties and molecular interactions through SwissADME analysis coupled with molecular docking along with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations evaluates Camptothecin, Topotecan, Belotecan and Rubitecan properties. Of the compounds studied Camptothecin and Rubitecan demonstrate limited adaptability with Belotecan showing highest degree of flexibility. Among the studied compounds Belotecan reveals maximum lipophilic properties but Exatecan demonstrates minimum lipophilic strength. Water solubility predictions demonstrate that Camptothecin and Topotecan exist with higher levels of water solubility compared to Belotecan and Exatecan thus indicating formulation difficulties might arise. Based on pharmacokinetic studies the drugs show good absorption through gastrointestinal tissues but demonstrate weak ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The drug-drug interaction risk becomes clearer because of CYP enzyme inhibition and P-glycoprotein substrate classification. Molecular docking examinations confirm Belotecan forms the strongest lysozyme and DNA binding interactions which outweigh Camptothecin interactions and Rubitecan displays weaker interactions between them. MD simulations show that stable interactions exist between the drugs and DNA where Belotecan and Camptothecin modify DNA structures thus improving their therapeutic outcomes. The analysis of hydrogen bonds demonstrates Camptothecin and Topotecan maintain steady binding interactions however Rubitecan displays the weakest contacts. Belotecan and Camptothecin present the most attractive pharmacological features despite needing additional work on solubility and metabolic stability optimization. The documented research outcomes contribute essential details about the molecular character of these substances that scientists can use to develop enhanced bioavailability requirements with better stability features and therapeutic applications.
